## ✨ What is MAHX Checkout?

MAHX (Magento + HTMX) Checkout is a clean, minimal, and extendable checkout system for Magento 2. It's designed for developers who love the Magento way — working with layouts, blocks, and controllers — but want a faster, JavaScript-light experience on the frontend.

---

## 💡 Why MAHX Checkout?

- ✅ **Magento-Native**: Built entirely using Magento layouts, blocks, and controllers — no magic, just Magento.
- ⚡ **Super Fast**: Powered by **HTMX** — minimal JavaScript, instant partial updates.
- 🧩 **Lightweight & Modular**: Uses **Alpine.js** and **TailwindCSS** for reactive behavior and clean styling.
- 👨‍💻 **Developer-Friendly**: Designed for Magento developers with the concepts they already familiar with.
- 🧘 **Zero State Management**: You heard it right! No state juggling in the frontend or PHP — everything lives cleanly at the database level, just as Magento intended.
- 📚 **Tiny Learning Curve**: If you know Magento, you’re already 90% there. Just learn HTMX — it's fun and you’ll pick it up in 2 hours!

## 👥 Who Should Use It?

MAHX Checkout works with **any monolithic Magento 2 storefront**, including:

- Luma
- Hyvä Themes
- Custom Magento 2 themes

If you're tired of bloated JavaScript-heavy checkouts, this is for you.

---

## 🧱 What It’s Not

MAHX Checkout is not a plug-and-play one-size-fits-all solution.

It’s more like a **DIY developer kit** for building your ideal checkout — using familiar Magento patterns (layouts, blocks, controllers). The default look resembles Luma, but everything is easily customizable.

---

## 💳 What About Payment & Shipping Methods?

Not all third-party shipping and payment methods will "just work" out of the box.

👉 You’ll need to **make them compatible** with MAHX Checkout’s structure. But don’t worry — the project provides clear guidance on how to do this easily. Check the docs for integration help.
